# BasicPortfolio
My Portfolio 2


Created a new Repository with a Name BasicPortfolio

* the Portfolio 'tab' is not finished, I have spent way too many hours trying to figure out how to fix it, 
 too many codes and too many changes i decided not to mess with it anymore in fear of breaking it all.

I will work with a TAs assistant or a Tutor to try and figure out what is wrong with my file. 

Hopefully i can get it fixed before the Homework is due.
