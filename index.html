      <p>My name is Saranda and I am originally from Kosovo and I have been living in the US for 9 years. I started working for Microsoft as a Data Analyst about 3.5 years ago, specifically with Bing Maps Streetside and aerial imagery. I work for a great team of Program Managers, Engineers and Developers who have ecuraged me and got me curious to try the technical part of the job, which is why i am enrolled in this program. During my free time i enjoy spending time with my very active, smart and beautiful 8 year old daughter.
